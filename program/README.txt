This program is like the game "2048". The rule of this game is you need to control all the blocks to move in the same direction. Two blocks with the same number collide and merge into their sum. After each operation, a 2 or 4 will be randomly generated. Finally, a "2048" block is won.You can keep play the game to get multiple of 2048 until the gameover.
