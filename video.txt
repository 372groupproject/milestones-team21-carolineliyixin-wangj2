For the video we want to talk about the basic information about the Lua.
We may talk history, advantage, and some special grammar or data srtucure in the Lua.
The code samples we want to use is that we write for the milestones.
Our program is a game, so that we can play it and explain this game.
We maybe use a power point and run the code on the computer to help us explain the Lua.
