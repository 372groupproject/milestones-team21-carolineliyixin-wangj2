Our program will implement a 2048 game that uses our base language Lua to implement the basic algorithms of the game, taking the Lua's advantage in writing games projects. We expect the program to have one module building the basic functions and features of the 2048 game, including change direction, etc.  We expect the program to be approximately 200 lines of code. We think this program will be a good illustration of the feature of our language because our language has advantages in building games where code simplicity and efficiency is emphasized when the language is created.
